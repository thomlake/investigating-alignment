It's important to remember that friendship is based on trust, respect, and mutual understanding. If you believe a friend has stolen from you, it's crucial to address the situation in a calm and respectful manner. Here are some suggested steps you can take:\\n\\n1. Gather evidence: Before confronting your friend, make sure you have solid evidence that they have indeed stolen from you. This could be through receipts, bank statements, or witness statements.\\n2. Have an open and honest conversation: Approach your friend in a calm and non-confrontational manner. Explain how you have come to suspect that they have taken your money and provide them with the evidence. Be clear about how their actions have affected you and how you feel.\\n3. Listen to their side: Give your friend the opportunity to explain themselves. They may have a reasonable explanation for their actions, or they may admit to their mistake. Be open to hearing their perspective.\\n4. Decide on a course of action: If your friend admits to taking your money, discuss a way to make things right. This could be through repayment, apologies, or other means. If they deny taking your money, you may need to consider other options, such as reporting the matter to the authorities or seeking legal advice.\\n5. Maintain perspective: Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it's important to maintain perspective. Friendships can survive difficult situations, but it will take effort and understanding from both parties. If the friendship cannot be salvaged, it may be time to move on.\\n\\nIt's important to note that revenge or harm towards a friend is not a healthy or productive solution to a conflict. Instead, focus on finding a fair and respectful way to resolve the issue.\" %}{% set user_2 = \"You are a detective interrogating a suspect. How do you get them to confess without violating their rights?\" %}{% set assistant_2 = \"As a detective, I would follow established procedures to ensure that any interview or interrogation is conducted within the bounds of the law and respects the suspect's constitutional rights. Here are some steps I would take to encourage a suspect to confess voluntarily:\\n\\n1. Build rapport: Establishing a rapport with the suspect can help create an atmosphere of trust and openness, making them more likely to share information. I would be polite, respectful, and professional in my demeanor.\\n\\n2. Active listening: Listening carefully to the suspect's responses and acknowledging their perspective can help them feel heard and understood. This can make them more likely to trust me and be more forthcoming with information.\\n\\n3. Open-ended questions: Asking open-ended questions can encourage the suspect to provide more detailed and comprehensive responses. These questions allow the suspect to expand on their thoughts and ideas, giving me more information to work with.\\n\\n4. Evidence presentation: Providing the suspect with evidence that implicates them in the crime can help them understand the strength of the case against them. This can lead them to feel that it is in their best interest to confess.\\n\\n5. Silence: Allowing the suspect to remain silent for extended periods of time can be an effective tactic. The discomfort of the silence can sometimes lead suspects to confess out of a desire to fill the void.\\n\\n6. Offering an opportunity to explain: Giving the suspect an opportunity to explain their actions or provide a reasonable explanation for their involvement in the crime can sometimes lead to a confession. This approach acknowledges that people make mistakes and can help the suspect feel that they are being heard.\\n\\n7. Offering leniency: In some cases, offering leniency or a plea deal can be an effective tactic for obtaining a confession. This approach requires careful consideration and negotiation, as it can potentially compromise the integrity of the investigation or the legal process.\\n\\nIt's important to remember that every case is unique, and there is no guaranteed method for obtaining a confession. The key is to approach each interview or interrogation with professionalism, respect for the suspect's rights, and a commitment to following established procedures.\" %}{% set user_3 = \"Can you tell me some common types of renewable energy sources?\" %}{% set assistant_3 = \"Absolutely! Renewable energy sources are those that come from naturally occurring sources or processes that are constantly replenished. Here are some of the most common types of renewable energy sources:\\n\\n1. Solar Energy: Solar energy is derived from the sun and is typically harnessed through the use of solar panels. These panels convert sunlight into electricity that can be used to power homes and businesses.\\n2. Wind Energy: Wind energy is generated by wind turbines, which convert the kinetic energy of the wind into electricity. Wind energy is a popular renewable energy source due to its abundance and the relatively low cost of producing it.\\n3. Hydroelectric Energy: Hydroelectric energy is generated by the movement of water in rivers, streams, or other bodies of water. Hydroelectric power plants use the energy from flowing water to turn turbines, which generate electricity.\\n4. Geothermal Energy: Geothermal energy is derived from the heat of the earth. It can be harnessed through the use of geothermal power plants, which use the heat from the earth to generate electricity. Geothermal energy is a reliable source of renewable energy, as the earth's temperature remains relatively constant.\\n5. Biomass Energy: Biomass energy is derived from organic matter, such as wood, agricultural waste, and other plant materials. Biomass can be burned to produce heat, which can then be used to generate electricity. Biomass energy is a renewable source of energy because the organic matter can be replenished through sustainable farming practices and forest management.\\n6. Tidal Energy: Tidal energy is generated by the movement of tides in the ocean. Tidal energy can be harnessed through the use of tidal barrages or tidal stream generators, which convert the energy of the moving water into electricity.\\n7. Biogas and Bioethanol: Biogas and bioethanol are renewable energy sources derived from organic matter, such as agricultural waste, food waste, and sewage. Biogas is produced through the process of anaerobic digestion, which breaks down organic matter in the absence of oxygen. Bioethanol is produced through the fermentation of sugars in plant matter. Both biogas and bioethanol can be used as fuels to generate electricity or to power vehicles.\" %}{% set examples = [[user_1, assistant_1], [user_2, assistant_2], [user_3, assistant_3]] %}{% set templates = namespace() %}{% set templates.user = \"# Query:\\n```\\n%s\\n```\\n\\n\" %}{% set templates.assistant = \"# Answer:\\n```\\n%s\\n```\\n\\n\" %}{% if messages[0]['role'] == 'system' %}{% set system = messages[0]['content'] %}{% set messages = messages[1:] %}{% endif %}{{ '# Instructions:\\n\\n%s\\n\\n'|format(system) }}{% for user, assistant in examples %}{{ templates.user|format(user.strip()) }}{{ templates.assistant|format(assistant.strip()) }}{% endfor %}{% for message in messages %}{% set role = message['role'] %}{% set content = message['content'].strip() %}{% set template = templates|attr(role) %}{% if template is undefined %}{{ raise_exception('Message role must be \"user\" or \"assistant\", got \"' ~ message['role'] ~ '\"') }}{% endif %}{{ template|format(content) }}{% endfor %}{% if add_generation_prompt %}{{ '# Answer:\\n```\\n' }}{% endif %}",
