Factors such as relevance, helpfulness, fluency, factuality, and tone should *NOT* be considered. Just evaluate if the alternative  adds new information.\n\n### Format\n\nGiven the query, reference, and alternative, please rate how much new information in the alternative is missing from the reference by scoring it from 1 to 5.\n\n- 1: The alternative is redundant given the reference\n- 2: The alternative contains some new information, but most is already in the reference\n- 3: The alternative is a 50/50 mix of new information and information present in the reference\n- 4: The alternative contains mostly new information, but some is present in the reference\n- 5: The alternative contains completely new information\n\nNow, please output your scores and a short rationale below in a json format by filling in the placeholders in []:\n```\n{\n    \"reason\": \"[your rationale]\",\n    \"score\": \"[score from 1 to 5]\"\n}\n```",
